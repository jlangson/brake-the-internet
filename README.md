# Brake The Internet

## What is this?

The beginnings of what will be a browser extension. The extension will slow down specific websites.

## Why slow down websites?

The point is to make internet usage less addictive. Social media wants a fast response rate to keep you engaged. By
causing a delay I hope this will make the internet less addictive.

## How does it work?

It sets the opacity to 0 and gradually increases. It doesn't actually load websites slower, but it simulates it.


## I want a certain feature added.

Make a pull request.


## Possible features

- Allow customization of slow down.
-- Perhaps different settings for different sites.
- Make it annoying/inconvenient to remove websites from slow down list (opt-in).
- Have suggested lists of problematic websites (reddit, facebook, twitter, instagram, pinterest, etc.)
- Exports/imports of lists.
